# Advent Of Code... Code

Each year [AdventOfCode.com](https://adventofcode.com) publishes an advent calendar
of coding puzzles in december.

In this repository I keep track of the puzzles I have already solved.

Besides that, it's a nice sample of various PHP code techniques and language features.
Some of which I don't regularly use, when I develop web applications.
